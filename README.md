# Deepfake_Detection

## Problem Statement:
Deep Fake Detection
Design a system to identify manipulated or synthetic media content across images, videos, and audio. The solution should work in real-time and explain why content is flagged as potentially fake. Performance will be judged on detection accuracy, processing speed, and robustness against new deep fake techniques.
